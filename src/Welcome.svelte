        For decades of development, we have constructed our own space station,
        Moon settlement and Mars settlement. Being the new CEO, your job is to
        operate missions , make profits and assure crewsâ€™ safety during the
        journey. Space industry has potential but is dangerous and always
        consumes a lot of resources. While doing the mission, you need to
        evaluate the budget seriously and find any potential risks to keep crews
        from accidents.You will begin the game with {$money} million USD and {$astronaut}
        astronauts, if one of them becomes 0, the game is over.

        In order to prove Bonk Space to be a reliable contractor, you must
        complete all three categories of missions: "Transportation", "Science"
        and "Tourism" at least once.
