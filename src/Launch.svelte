        After months of preparation, everything comes together at last. You and
        your employees are sitting in the command center, watching the fuel tank
        of the spacecraft being filled up.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rocket you are going to launch is {$rocketName}, code name: {uniqueNamesGenerator(
            {
                dictionaries: [colors, animals],
                separator: "",
                length: 2,
                style: "capital",
            }
        )}. It will travel to {$destination} and complete its mission: {$missionDescription}.
    </p>
    <p>
        It carries {$carrying} ton(s) of payload out of its {$capacity} ton(s) of
        capacity. According to statistics , the success rate is {$successRate.toLocaleString(
            "en",
            { style: "percent" }
        )}.
    </p>
    <p>Now itâ€™s your turn to press the launch button.</p>
